ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cristian, Iâ€™m interested in extracting information from satellite imagery and geospatial data supported by statistical and machine learning algorithms. Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher developing novel methods for near-real time monitoring of climate extremes and carbon landscapes from SAR imagery. 

Some of my interesting repos include:
- Our work covering the Kakhovka Dam explosion in Ukraine [here](https://github.com/crisjosil/Deep-learning-based-flood-tracking-in-Kakhovka-dam-Ukraine-from-SAR-imagery-). I trained and tested a few different architectures of deep learning models on a dataset that I curated covering several flood events. 
- A post about how to use the Google Earth Engine python API directly in QGIS. In this case, I show an example of flood monitoring [here](https://github.com/crisjosil/Flood_mapping_Sentinel1_in_QGIS).
- A side project working on image object detection with the YoloV8 model pretrained by ultralytics [here](https://github.com/crisjosil/Aerial_object_detection_tests). I also containerised this as an app and deployed it using microsoft azure. You can interact with this app [here](https://yo-detection.azurewebsites.net/). The plan is to retrain the model for aerial object detection (in process).
