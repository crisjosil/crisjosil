ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cristian, Iâ€™m interested in extracting information from satellite imagery and geospatial data using statistical and machine learning algorithms. Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher developing novel methods for near-real time monitoring of climate extremes and carbon landscapes from SAR imagery. 

Some of my repos include:
- Our work covering the Kakhovka Dam explosion in Ukraine [here](https://github.com/crisjosil/Deep-learning-based-flood-tracking-in-Kakhovka-dam-Ukraine-from-SAR-imagery-). I trained and tested a few different architectures of deep learning models on a dataset that I curated covering several flood events. 
- A post about how to use the Google Earth Engine python API directly in QGIS. In this case, I show an example of flood monitoring [here](https://github.com/crisjosil/Flood_mapping_Sentinel1_in_QGIS).
- A side project working on image object detection with the YoloV8 model pretrained by ultralytics [here](https://github.com/crisjosil/Aerial_object_detection_tests). I also containerised this as an app and deployed it using microsoft azure. You can interact with this app [here](https://yo-detection.azurewebsites.net/) (may take some time to load as it is the free version without pre-warmed workers). The plan is to retrain this model for aerial object detection (in process).
- After hearing in the news about a wildfire that could become the largest in the UK, I checked for satellite imagery covering the area and used a well known method for mapping fires. Check some outcomes of this [here]()
- xarray
- PolSAR paper: Repo of a peer reviewd publication using Quad-PolSAR and machine learning for crop monitoring [here](https://github.com/crisjosil/MT-PolSAR-Change-Detection-For-Crop-Monitoring-And-Classification).  
- Hydrological data API: A notebook for quering an API to fetch hydrological data from a network of IoT sensors distributed accross Scotland. I also use folium and geopandas for data analysis [here](https://github.com/crisjosil/Weather_data_API/blob/master/Scotland_forth_valley_data.ipynb). 
- A colab notebook which downloads surface soil moisture data from the ECMWF-ERA5 dataset via the Google Earth engine python API. It reads the areas of interest from a polygon, filters the image collection and downloads the desired data (.csv)[here](https://github.com/crisjosil/Useful_GIS_and_data_Science_scripts/blob/master/GEE_ERA5_Time_series_from_polygons.ipynb)  
- I have several private repos including  (and others):
-   A Dockerised ETL pipeline for ingestion of IoT data into an Azure hosted Postgress dB. This process is triggered by event-driven azure functions (serverless computing).
-   A Dockerised ETL pipeline for download, pre-processing and serving satellite imagery.
