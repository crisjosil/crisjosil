ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cristian, Iâ€™m interested in extracting information from satellite imagery supported by statistical and machine learning algorithms. Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher developing novel methods for near-real time monitoring of surface water extent from SAR imagery. This includes soil moisture and peatland water table depth monitoring and flood/drought mapping applications. I am also developing the data ingestion and processing chains to make these algorithms operational.
