ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cristian, Iâ€™m interested in extracting information from satellite imagery supported by statistical and machine learning algorithms. Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher developing novel methods for near-real time monitoring of climate extremes and carbon landscapes from SAR imagery.
